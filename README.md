# SnakesCLI

The Classic Snake game designed for Terminal on Mac OS X

## Libraries

- [CxxTest](http://cxxtest.com/) v4.1.3: CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit

- [cmdline](https://github.com/tanakh/cmdline.git): A really straight-forward command line parser for C++, based on STL.

## To-Do

1. Refactor SnakeGame.cpp (too much logic in one class)
2. Refactor Makefile (switch to SCons?)
